# Python Snake Game

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game, created using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that grows in length each time it consumes food, and the objective is to avoid running into the walls or the snake's own tail.

## How to Play
- To play the game, run `main.py`.
- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- Try to eat the food that appears on the screen to increase your score.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's body.
- The game starts immediately upon running the program.
- No additional installation is required, as the Turtle library is included in the standard Python library.
